## Purpose

Allow easily introduce `chaos` to a cloud function with opinioned configuration.

We are still reviewing the best way to progress the work.

## TODO

- [ ] review how do we do dynamic injection
- [ ] review rule engine and define constraints
- [ ] review usage of forked version of `mitm` and trim to the latest code
- [ ] expand testing approach
